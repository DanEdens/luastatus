This barlib talks with `lemonbar`.

It joins all non-empty strings returned by widgets by a separator, which defaults to ` | `.

Redirections and `luastatus-lemonbar-launcher`
===
`lemonbar` requires all the data to be written to stdout and read from stdin. This makes it very easy to mess things up: Lua’s `print()` prints to stdout, processes spawned by widgets/plugins inherit our stdin and stdout, etc.
That’s why this barlib requires that stdin and stdout file descriptors are manually redirected.

A launcher, `luastatus-lemonbar-launcher`, is shipped with it; it spawns `lemonbar` (or whatever is in `LEMONBAR` environment variable) connected to a bidirectional pipe and executes `luastatus` (or whatever is in `LUASTATUS` environment variable) with `-b lemonbar` (or whatever is in `LUASTATUS_LEMONBAR_BARLIB` environment variable), all the required `-B` options, and additional arguments passed by you.

Pass each `lemonbar` argument with `-p`, then pass `--`, then pass luastatus arguments, e.g.:
````bash
luastatus-lemonbar-launcher -p -B#111111 -p -f'Droid Sans Mono for Powerline:pixelsize=12:weight=Bold' -- -Bseparator=' ' widget1.lua widget2.lua
````

`cb` return value
===
A string with lemonbar markup, a table of such strings (all non-empty elements of which are joined by the separator), or nil. Nil or an empty table is equivalent to an empty string.

Functions
===
`escape` escapes text for lemonbar markup.

`event` argument
===
A string with a name of the command.

Options
===
* `in_fd=<fd>`

  File descriptor to read `lemonbar` input from. Usually set by the launcher.

* `out_fd=<fd>`

  File descriptor to write to. Usually set by the launcher.

* `separator=<string>`

  Set the separator.
