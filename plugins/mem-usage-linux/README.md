This derived plugin periodically polls Linux `procfs` for memory usage.

Functions
===

  - `get_usage()`: returns a table with two entries, `avail` and `total`. Both have `value` (a number) and `unit` (a string) entries;
    you can assume both units are always `kB`s.

  - `widget(tbl)`

      Constructs a `widget` table required by luastatus. `tbl` is a table with
      the following fields:

      **(required)**

      * `cb`: a callback function that will be called with a table same as that returned by `get_usage()`;

      **(optional)**

      * `timer_opts`: options for the underlying `timer` plugin;

      * `event`: event entry of the resulting table.
